MERGED VEHICLE SECTION TEMPLATE - For reference during implementation

This file contains the structure for the merged Vehicle Management section that combines:
1. Vehicle Basic Details (registration, make, model, etc.)
2. Vehicle Documents (RC, insurance, PUC, permits, etc.)
3. Equipment & Medical Supplies (stretcher, oxygen, monitoring equipment, etc.)

Key Features:
- Multiple vehicle profiles support with Add/Edit/Delete
- Card-based list view showing all vehicles
- Comprehensive edit form with all merged fields
- File upload support for documents
- Equipment checkboxes with conditional fields
- Wired to handleAddNewVehicle, handleEditVehicle, handleSaveVehicle, handleDeleteVehicle

Structure:
- Section Header with "Add New Vehicle" button
- Empty state message (if no vehicles)
- Vehicle profile cards with:
  * Vehicle type, registration number, make/model
  * Quick info: Insurance expiry, PUC validity, equipment count
  * Edit and Delete buttons
- Edit Form (when isEditingVehicle === true):
  * Basic Details subsection (12 fields)
  * Documents subsection (14 file uploads + insurance/PUC details)
  * Equipment subsection (40+ checkboxes and conditional fields)
- Save and Cancel buttons

Implementation Note:
Due to the size (~1200 lines of merged code), this template serves as a guide.
The actual implementation will be done directly in AmbulanceDashboard.jsx
